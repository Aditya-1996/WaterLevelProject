                                 AUDRINO AIDED AUTOMATED WATER LEVEL CONTROLLER WITH REAL TIME MONITORING          
                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------
                                    
    This audrino aided hardware project can carry out various functions including the sensing and reporting of water level in the tank. 
    It has the added capability of temperature and moisture sensing and live feedback. The filling of water can be configured in 3 states 
    inluding manual OFF, manual ON and automated water level. 
    
    We estimate that this can save upto 200mL of water every month in a typical house of 4. Hence, several thousands of lives can be saved
    in India alone every year.
